# CMPE326-HW2-Matrix-Calculations

Task 1: Define a function "row-max" which takes a matrix as an input and returns the max of each row as a list.

Task 2: Define a function "row-avg" which takes a matrix as an input and returns the average of each row as a list.

Task 3: Define a function "norm-inf" which takes a square matrix as an input and returns infinite norm.

**Note**

I also added the converted version of the same logic in Java. (Which can be found in Main.java)
